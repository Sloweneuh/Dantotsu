# 3.7.0

- **Features:**
  - Added MAL Interest Stacks
    - Interest Stacks are not supported by the MAL API, so it takes a bit to load
    - Only media that has an Anilist entry linked to the MAL media found in a stack will be displayed (only really a problem with manga, pretty much all anime are on both websites)
