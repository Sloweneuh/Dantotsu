# **Dantotsu** 🌟

Dantotsu is an [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) only client.

This is a fork of the original [Dantotsu](https://git.rebelonion.dev/rebelonion/Dantotsu), modified based on my own needs.

> **Dantotsu (断トツ; Dan-totsu)** literally means "the best of the best" in Japanese. Try it out for yourself and be the judge!
